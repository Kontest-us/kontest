# KontestHub

Itâ€™s simple: an online, contest-hosting platform that MAXIMIZES student collaboration and freedom while MINIMIZING teacher work!

## Next Update

In a few months, we will be adding support for MATH contests. We hope to allow students to use this platform for in-classroom review before tests/quizzes, competitive math contests, and much more!
