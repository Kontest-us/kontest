## Background
Kontest.us is an online, contest-hosting platform that MAXIMIZES student collaboration and freedom while MINIMIZING teacher work! Our platform supports two types of games: review games and estimation (similar to an Estimathon) games. This repository contains the frontend and API for our platform. Kontest.us was worked on from January 2021 - August 2021 by [Ashay Parikh](https://ashayp.com/) and [Labdhi Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/labdhi-jain). It was made open-source in August 2022, and is open for anyone to use or develop!
